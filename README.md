# Work Day Scheduler
This app will first display the day+time+date+timezone on page load, and will have time-blocks from 8AM-5PM, which will have dynamically generated color-coding to indicate 
the order of importance of the time-blocks within it. Grey will indicate a time in the past, red will idicate a current time, and green will idicate a time in the future.
The app will allow the user to click the time-blocks to enter text between the time and button at each end of the block. Once the user has entered text into the block they
will be able to click the button at the end of the associated block to save the entered text. On page reload, the text the user inputed will remain persistent, and 
automatically populate itself onto the appropriate block.
